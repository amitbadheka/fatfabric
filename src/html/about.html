  	<h2>Whatcha All About?</h2>
		<p>Unless we find a way to keep track of new facts, information and knowledge that our world is generating on "stream", we stand the risk of losing out on insights that would have made us go "Aha! that’s what I was looking for, since a long time."<br>
		As a result, we let our brains get fat, and well.... that ain't good for nobody.</p>

	<h2>So Fatty Am I?</h2>
		<p>FatFabric is built with a simple thing in mind. Feel the Burrrrrrn! Mentally speaking, of course ;)<br>
		FatFabric let's you combine the best RSS threads out there on the interwebs into neat categories (thread + thread = fabric geddit?)</p>

	<h2>Drop on Me the Trifecta will you?</h2>
		<p>If we had to tell you the top 3 things this BIG BAD BOY can help you do:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Keep a track of the latest breaks across web resources, all in one window, without having a million tabs open</li>
				<li>Segment the news sources around one theme ("fabric") based on topics, activities or plain madness! 15 threads per fabric for now</li>
				<li>It's SEPARATE from you main browser, so unlike the big friendly zebra bear version ;) you just do you… until you feel the need to gorge like a fatty!</li>
			</ol>

	<h2>Winter is Coming! - Special (it's got to sometime right?)</h2>
		<p>We've got you setup with an initial list of sources to get the ball rolling. Plus, you can add in your own RSS to any of the lists, customise it as per your wicked needs.<br>
		We are thinking up some sweet other uses of this platform so in case some bolt of amaze hits you, shoot us some love@pykih.com </p>

		<p>Hang Loose! \m/</p>
